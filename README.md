# About

The global transportation sector is a major polluter and in 2020 produced approximately 7.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Passenger cars were the biggest source of emissions that year, accounting for 41 percent of global transportation emissions.</br>
</br>
In recent decades, global CO2 emissions from passenger cars have increased and peaked at 3.2 billion metric tons in 2019. Car emissions fell in 2020, but this was only due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Medium and heavy trucks are the second- largest polluters, accounting for 22 percent of transportation emissions. Although this was half the emissions of passenger cars, there are considerably fewer trucks on the road, showing just how polluting global road freight is. In 2020, heavy-duty truck CO2 emissions totaled almost two billion metric tons.

# Dataset

Dataset provide model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.

The dataset used in this project has been taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles?select=CO2+Emissions_Canada.csv). This Kaggle dataset is a compiled version of data provided by Government of Canada ([Original data](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64#wb-auto-6)) and containes data for 7 years. Also, dataset and data description files have been uploaded to project repository.
